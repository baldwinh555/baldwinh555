Hello, I am @baldwinh555.

I am interested in transitioning to a career in data science. As a scientist, I have always been passionate about data-driven decisions. The most recent project I have been priveleged to serve an integral role in has largely overlapped with the role of data scientist due to the degree of coding, analysis, workflow development, and stakeholder involvement. I am interested in pursuing the role of data scientist for the remainder of my career. The bulk of my coding experience has been with R (R Studio). Therefore, I am diligently working to expand my skillset by earning a Data Science certification from the IBM Coursera program. This program teaches data science using Python (instead of R). Through this program, I am gaining experience with the Python and SQL languages, several Science packages in Python, Jupyter notebooks, cloud platforms, and common data science analyses that I am more or less familiar with. 

I can be reached at baldwinh555@gmail.com.
