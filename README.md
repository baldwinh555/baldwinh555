Hello, I am @baldwinh555.

I am interested in transitioning to a career in data science. As a scientist, I have always been passionate about data-driven decisions. The most recent project I have been priveleged to serve an integral role in has largely overlapped with the role of data scientist due to the degree of coding, analysis, workflow development, and stakeholder involvement. I am interested in pursuing the role of data scientist for the remainder of my career. The bulk of my coding experience has been with R (R Studio). I am diligently working to expand my skillset. I am currently working through a Data Science certification using Python to gain experience with the Python language and associated Data Science packages, Jupyter notebooks, cloud platforms, and common data science analyses that I am less familiar with. 

I can be reached at baldwinh555@gmail.com.
